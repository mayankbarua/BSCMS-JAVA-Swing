### Blood Supply Chain Management System

##Problem Statement
Our application mainly deals with following major problems of current scenario:
* Manual approach: The communication gap between donor and recipient.
* Manual approach: Currently, major blood banks follow the manual approach for processing
blood. With the manual approach, there are problems in managing bloodstock, blood donor
details, and request details.
## The communication gap between donor and recipient: Due to the lack of communication
between the blood donors and the blood recipients, most of the patients in need of blood do not
get the blood on time. So, it is required to make synchronization between the blood donors,
recipient, and the blood banks. This improper management of blood leads to wastage of the
available blood inventory.
